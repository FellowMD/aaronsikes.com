[PIPES!!](/apps/pipes/)

There are scores of 'plumbing' games out there that involve spinning
pipes around, and they all have slight variations on rules, level
generation, and controls.

I'd played many but the one I was addicted to was just perfect. I
haven't been able to find a version since that nailed the right
combination of tree-based levels, level difficulty, and quick snappy
controls.

I wrote this because I was lying in bed thinking about this game, and
light-bulb style came up with an algorithm for level generation. At
the risk of getting no work done for the rest of the week, I got up
and put this together in a few hours. Luckily I'm  a bit better at
moderation nowadays :)
